# Aloo
[Aloo] is simple way to create and share real-time analytical dashboards with others.
Think of it as **GIST for data**.

## Why?
[Aloo] was build for [Rails Rumble 2014][rumble] in 48 hours time frame. I build it becouse I could. ;) Please read my [blog post](http://otobrglez.opalab.com/rails/2014/10/24/aloo-on-rails-rumble-2014.html) about Aloo and my participation on Rails Rumble.
